Net-TCP-ConnHandler version 0.01
================================

Net::TCP::ConnHandler is a simple event driven framework for TCP sockets.
It provides a simple protocol, with no intrinsic overhead (besides the 
packet length information), allowing full control to the underlaying 
socket, if necessary, but providing higher level ways of transmitting
information.
